## Hi there 👋

Data analyst with a background in international business, focused on turning messy, real-world data into usable insights.
I work mainly with public datasets, spending most of my time on data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis, then translating results into clear, decision-oriented outputs.

**Tech stack:** SQL, Python, Excel, Power BI.

**Interests:** making imperfect data tell a coherent story. I enjoy projects where the data is incomplete, inconsistent, or poorly structured, and the task is to make it trustworthy again.
